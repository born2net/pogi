##Does it support prepared statements?
At the moment not, we can add it, but according to 
[this](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Parameterized-queries-and-Prepared-Statements)
they do not add big values.

##Is there any company behind it?
It was originally developed at [www.labcup.net](http://www.labcup.net/), where we also use it.
